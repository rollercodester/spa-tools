# @spa-tools


## Introduction

_@spa-tools_ is a collection of packages aimed at helping engineers to _better-build_ Single-Page Applications.
It came about from years of shipping real-world, business-focused SPAs and taking a handful of the resulting wants+learnings
and distilling them into a set of packages that can be used in any modern Web project.

### Motivation

Aside from the earnest intent of giving back to the community, the other is to offer frontend developers simple and efficient alternatives to other webapp tools.
