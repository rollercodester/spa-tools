## Introduction

_@spa-tools_ is a collection of packages aimed at helping engineers to _better-build_ Single-Page Applications.
It came about from years of shipping real-world, business-focused SPAs and taking a handful of the resulting wants+learnings
and distilling them into a set of packages that can be used in any modern Web project.

### Motivation

Aside from the earnest intent of giving back to the community, the other is to offer frontend developers simple and efficient alternatives to other webapp tools.

## Docsite

View the [@spa-tools documentation site](https://spa-tools.github.io) for complete reference.

or comment on an existing issue. From there we can discuss the feature or bugfix you're interested in and how best to approach it.
In terms of workflow, we use the standard approach of forking the repo, creating a PR, and merging after tesing/approval.

### Unit Test Coverage

All packages in @spa-tools require 100% unit test coverage. This is a condition for all PRs to be merged whether you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug.

The only exception is when native code is being wrapped and coverage is either not possible or redundant, which can be discussed on a case-by-case basis
during the approval process.
