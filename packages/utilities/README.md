## Motivation

All real-world SPAs have to deal with configuration, typcially having to manage settings that vary across mutliple environments. The defacto approach to solve this problem has been to use multiple .env files using a package such as _dotenv_, which in its own right is a fantastically proven package.

And while it's true that the static dotenv flow has been standardized for quite some time now, it typically involves maintaining build scripts in lockstep with devops pipelines to ensure that pseudo environment-variables are available to your SPA across respective environments. Let's be honest, this can become a bit of a headache and arguably, pseudo-env-vars can feel yucky in frontend code.

As such, I started using the runtime-config pattern in SPAs a few years back and have not looked back, since.
