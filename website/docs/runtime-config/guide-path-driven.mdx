# Path Driven Environments

By default, envrionment configurations are driven by the hostname of the running application. This is a good
fit if you use subdomains to differentiate between environments. However, if you instead use a
single domain and differentiate between environments using paths, then the Runtime Config still
has you covered.

To turn this feature on, simply set the
`startsWithMatching` flag to `true` and then the path will be included in matching environment configs.

Let's take a quick look at an example:

```js
import { BaseConfigSettings, DomainConfig, RuntimeConfig } from '@spa-tools/runtime-config';

interface MyAppConfigSettings extends BaseConfigSettings {
  authClientId: string;
  myAppApiUrl: string;
}

const myAppConfigSet: DomainConfig<MyAppConfigSettings> = {
  'myapp.com/dev': {
    environment: 'development',
    authClientId: 'auth-client-id-dev',
    myAppApiUrl: 'https://api.dev.myapp.com',
  },
  'myapp.com/test': {
    environment: 'test',
    authClientId: 'auth-client-id-uat',
    myAppApiUrl: 'https://api.uat.myapp.com',
  },
  // notice that we didn't have to use the path approach for the production environment
  // because exact hostname matching takes priority; however, if you do this, know
  // that any path that does not match a specific environment will default to matching
  // your production config; if you want to avoid this, you can add a path for prod
  // as well, but understandably, it's more desirable to not see any environment-specific
  // indicator in the URL for production
  'myapp.com': {
    environment: 'production',
    authClientId: 'auth-client-id-prod',
    myAppApiUrl: 'https://api.myapp.com',
  },
  localhost: {
    environment: 'dev',
    authClientId: 'auth-client-id-dev',
    myAppApiUrl: 'https://api.dev.myapp.com',
  },
};

// here we initialize the runtime config for our app and use the startsWithMatching option
export const myAppRuntimeConfig = RuntimeConfig.initialize<MyAppConfigSettings, MyAppEnvironments>(myAppConfigSet, { startsWithMatching: true });

// now we can use the runtime config to get the current environment config that is based on
// the hostname and path using a starts-with match
```
