# Obfuscation

The Runtime Config bundles all of your environment config-sets into your build, which
has an advantage over other .env approaches of keeping your transipiled bits unchanged and
the same between build environments. However, a potential downside to this is that all
environment configs get leaked to every environment you deploy to.

### Leakage mitigation

Of course the optimal, secure solution to address this leakage concern is to protect your
non-prod, lower API environments via VPC, VPN, WAF, etc., which is the best guidance any security-minded
professional could give on the topic.

Nonetheless, the Runtime Config provides a means to
_softly_ address this concern via an obfuscation utility that accepts an encoded config
and outputs it as an encrypted static asset. This encrypted _asset_ can then be used
to initialize the Runtime Config, which in turn will be automatically decrypted+decoded
at runtime.

### Is the obfuscation feature 100% secure?

While the encryption algo used is very strong (256-bit), the answer still has to be "NO".
Any serious hacker could eventually figure out how to decrypt your config. But it does add
a layer of "obfuscation" that makes it more difficult for a casual hacker to access your
environment configs. **AND since you should NEVER include anything truly private in your SPA
build**, it shouldn't be worth a hacker's time to do so. Moverover, it makes your config
unfriendly to the human eye, thus mitigating a curious search for raw endpoint URLs in the
bundled source code.

### So should I obfuscate my config?

At the end of the day, it's really up to you but for guidance sake...

- If your lower API environments are locked down, then obfuscation would be overkill and frankly an unwarranted
  effort/maintenance tax

- Likewise, if your lower API environments are wide-open BUT leaking non-active environment
  config is NOT a big deal to you, then by all means keep it simple and forego

- However, if you do care AND your lower API environments are all public and wide-open,
  then it's seriously a good idea to obfuscate your config-sets

## @ Run-time in your SPA

### Using a static, obfuscated config-file

```js
// depending on your build setup, you may need to import the file differently
import obfuscatedConfigStr from './myapp-config-obf.txt?raw';

// let's initialize a new runtime config straight from the obfuscated string
const myAppRuntimeConfig = await RuntimeConfig.initializeObf(obfuscatedConfigStr);

console.log('The config settings are automatically deobfuscated:');
console.log(myAppRuntimeConfig.settings);
```

## @ Build-time via CLI

### Obfuscating a domain-config file

Call the `obf` command with the CLI utility using the domain-config input
file path and the obfuscated output file path.

```bash
npx @spa-tools/runtime-config obf myapp-config.json myapp-config-obf.txt
```

### Deobfuscating a domain-config file

If by remote chance you lose your domain-config file and all you have is the obfuscated
file, you can call the `deobf` command with the CLI utility to recreate it.

```bash
npx @spa-tools/runtime-config deobf myapp-config-obf.txt myapp-config.json
```

## @ Build-time via NodeJS

### Obfuscating a domain-config

```js
import { nodejsObfuscateConfig } from '@spa-tools/runtime-config';
// let's assume we've already created a domain-config in code
// that we're importing here (see Getting Started for more info)
import { myAppConfigSet } from './myapp-config';

// here simply we pass in our domain-config along with an output filepath
const obfuscatedConfig = nodejsObfuscateConfig(myAppConfigSet, 'obfuscated-config.txt');
// the obfuscated domain-config has now been saved to the file system
console.log('Here is the obfuscated string:');
console.log(obfuscatedConfig);
```

### Deobfuscating a domain-config

```js
import { nodejsDeobfuscateConfig } from '@spa-tools/runtime-config';

const deobfuscatedConfig = nodejsDeobfuscateConfig(obfuscatedConfig, 'deobfuscated-config.txt');
// the deobfuscated domain-config has now been saved to the file system
console.log('Here is the deobfuscated string:');
console.log(deobfuscatedConfig);
```

### Exporting a domain-config

```js
import { nodejsExportConfig } from '@spa-tools/runtime-config';

// here simply we pass in our domain-config along with an output filepath
nodejsExportConfig(myAppConfigSet, 'myapp-config.json');
// the domain-config has now been saved to the file system (unobfuscated)
```
