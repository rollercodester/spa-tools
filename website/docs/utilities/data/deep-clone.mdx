# deepClone()

The ES6 spread `...` operator was a huge game changer when it was released. And
for simple object/array copies, it's the go-to choice. But as powerful as it is,
it falls short for copying objects or arrays that hold
nested reference values.

This is where the `deepClone<T>()` function comes in. It's a simple utility that allows you to
deeply clone an object or array, including nested reference values.

The generic `T` type is used to define the type of data being cloned.

### Usage

```ts
import { deepClone } from '@spa-tools/utilities';

const original = {
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA'
  },
  hobbies: ['reading', 'coding'],
  name: 'John'
  children: [
    { name: 'Alice',
      attributes: { age: 10, eyeColor: 'blue', hairColor: 'brown' }
    },
    { name: 'Sam',
      attributes: { age: 8, eyeColor: 'green', hairColor: 'blonde'}
    },
  ]
};

const cloned = deepClone(original);

console.log(cloned);
console.log(cloned === original);
// --> false
console.log(cloned.children[0] === original.children[0]);
// --> false
console.log(cloned.children[0].attributes === original.children[0].attributes);
// --> false
```

### Arguments

| Name    | Type | Description       |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------- |
