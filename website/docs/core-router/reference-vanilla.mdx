# Vanilla Reference

The Core Router is designed to be framework agnostic and can be used with any JavaScript
library. This reference will cover the usage of the Core Router with
Typescript but works for Javascript as well (simply ignore all type usage).

## routesFactory()

The `routesFactory<R>` function returns a factory method, which when called transforms route
definitions into a _routes_ object. The resulting routes object is what you use in your app whenever
you need to provide routes to a Core Router or when you need to specify a route for navigation.

The generic `R` type is used to define the shape of the route that will be created and must
extend the default [`CoreRoute`](#coreroute) type.

### Usage

```ts
import { CoreRoute, routesFactory } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

// adding custom properties to your routes is as simple
// as creating an interface that extends CoreRoute
interface MyCustomRoute extends CoreRoute {
  requiresAuth: boolean;
}

// to create your routes, first generate a route factory method
const createMyRoutes = routesFactory<MyCustomRoute>();

// next define and create all of your routes, which you'll
// typically export to use throughout your app
export const myRoutes = createMyRoutes({
  dashboardRoute: {
    path: '/',
    requiresAuth: true,
  },
  financialsRoute: {
    path: '/financials',
    requiresAuth: true,
  },
  loginRoute: {
    path: '/login',
    requiresAuth: false,
  },
  signupRoute: {
    path: '/signup',
    requiresAuth: false,
  },
});
```

## CoreRouter

The `CoreRouter` class is used to create a new instance of a Core Router which is where all of the routing logic is encapsulated.

### Usage

```ts
import { CoreRouter } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

const myRouter = CoreRouter.initialize(myRoutes, myOptions);

myRouter.navigate(myRoutes.dashboardRoute);
```

### Constructor

| Parameter | Type                                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                                                                       |

| `routes`  | `Record<string, R>`                       | yes       | -       | The routes are created using a factory method generated via [`routesFactory`](#routesfactory). |
| `options` | [`CoreRouterOptions`](#corerouteroptions) | no        | -       | See the [Options](#corerouteroptions) section for details.                                     |

### navigate()

The `navigate` method is used to navigate to a new route.

| Parameter | Type                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `route`   | `R` or `string`           | yes       | -       | Must be _EITHER_ one of the routes that were created using the factory method generated via [`routesFactory`](#routesfactory) _OR_ the respective route's path. |
| `state`   | `Record<string, unknown>` | no        | -       | The state to be passed to the new route.                                                                                                                        |
| `hash`    | `string`                  | no        | -       | The hash to be passed to the new route, which will trigger an auto-scroll after navigation on target element if one exists.                                     |

## CoreRouterOptions

The `CoreRouterOptions` type is used to define the options that can be passed to the `CoreRouter` constructor.

### Usage

```ts
import { CoreRouterOptions } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

const myOptions: CoreRouterOptions<MyCustomRoute> = {
  basePath: '/app',
  fallbackRoute: myRoutes.dashboardRoute,
  fallbackState: { error: '404' },
  onRouteChange: (route, state) => {
    console.log('Route changed to:', route, 'with state:', state);
  },
  onRouteRequest: (newRoute, newState) => {
    console.log('Route requested:', newRoute, 'with state:', newState);
  },
};
```

## CoreRoute

`CoreRoute` is the base type that all Core Router routes must extend.

| Property                      | Type             | Required? | Default | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `hashScrollBehavior`          | `ScrollBehavior` | no        | -       | Determines the scroll behavior when hash links are auto-srolled on route navigation.                                                                                                                                                          |

| `removeUnusedQueryParams`     | `boolean`        | no        | `true`  | If `true`, any query string placeholders that are not used to interpolate the URL will be removed from path (i.e. discard orhpaned placeholders).                                                                                             |

## CoreRouteChangePayload

`CoreRouteChangePayload<R>` is the object that is passed to the `onRouteChange` callback when a route change has been processed.

| Property | Type                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                |

| `state`  | `Record<string, unknown>` | no        | -       | The state that was passed to the route. |

## CoreRouteRequestPayload

`CoreRouteRequestPayload<R>` is the object that is passed to the `onRouteRequest` callback when a route change request is pending and ready to act on.

| Property   | Type                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                               |

| `oldState` | `Record<string, unknown>` | no        | -       | The state of the last request that was approved.       |

## CoreRouteResponse

`CoreRouteResponse<R>` is the response that the consumer returns from within the `onRouteRequest` callback when a route change request
is pending and ready to act on. This is used to determine how the Core Router should proceed with the route change request and <strong>thus is
the mechanisim by which consumers maintain absolute control over routing flow logic</strong>.
