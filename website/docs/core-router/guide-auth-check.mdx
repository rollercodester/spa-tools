# Pre-Route Auth Check

The `@spa-tools/core-router` package provides a way to execute pre-processing logic before navigating to a route. A common scenario that falls into this workflow is performing a check to ensure the user is authenticated prior to route execution.

```js
import { CoreRouter, routesFactory } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

const createMyRoutes = routesFactory();

// here we create two routes, one that requires auth and one that does not
//
// the authCheck is a 100% custom property that we will use to determine
// whether or not authorization is required before allowing navigation to
// the route; it is NOT a built-in property of the route object and can be
// anything we want, which makes route flow control very flexible/powerful
const myRoutes = createMyRoutes({
  loginRoute: {
    authCheck: false,
    path: '/login',
  },
  membersOnlyRoute: {
    authCheck: true,
    path: '/members-only',
  },
});

// this is just a contrived function that emulates an auth check by
// returning a promise that resolves to a random boolean
function fakeAuthCheck() {
  const randomAuthState = Math.random() < 0.5 ? true : false;
  return Promise.resolve(randomAuthState);
}

// here we create a new instance of the CoreRouter class and pass in
// our routes object; we also pass in an object that implements two
// router lifecycle callbacks
const myRouter = CoreRouter.initialize(myRoutes, {
  onRouteRequest: async (routeRequest) => {
    // if the new route has an authCheck property set to `true`
    // then we will perform an async check to see if the user
    // is authorized to navigate to this route
    const isAuthorized = routeRequest.newRoute.authCheck ? await fakeAuthCheck() : true;

    if (!isAuthorized) {
      // if the user is not authorized to navigate to the route, we
      // will redirect to the login route; we pass the original route
      // request as state so that the login view can hypothetically
      // redirect back to the original route after login
      //
      // we could've just called the navigate method here, but to keep
      // the browser history clean, we instead perform a redirect by
      // returning a 2-element tuple containing redirect route and state
      return [myRoutes.loginRoute, routeRequest];
    }

    // this means either the user is authorized or the route does not
    // require authorization, so we return true to allow the navigation
    //
    // we could've also omitted the return altogether and it would have
    // the same effect, but returning true is more explicit
    return true;
  },
  onRouteChange: (routeChange) => {
    // this is where we would perform any post-processing logic, which
    // typically means rendering the requested route. How to do this
    // ranges based on the UI framework being used, so here we simply
    // log the route path to the console.
    //
    // If you're using React or want to create an abstraction for a
    // different rendering package/framework, you should definitely
    // check out the Core React Router abstraction, which has the
    // rendering logic sweetly baked in.
    console.log(`TODO: Render the approved route: ${routeChange.route.path}`);
  },
});

myRouter.navigate(
  // request to nav to a route that requires auth
  myRoutes.membersOnlyRoute
);
```
