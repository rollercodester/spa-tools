# asStrategy()

The `asStrategy<P>()` TypeScript utility takes a `Record` type and returns it
with some special sauce as to enable intellisense on the respective record.
Think of this as enabling your Record to behave like a static/instance class
in the IDE but with neither the perf hit nor the verbose code.

This becomes useful if you have a complex object and you use it in many places,
so gaining intellisense on the record's keys can really help with productivity.

The generic `P` defines the type (or unioned types) returned from the strategy `Record` values.

### Usage

```ts
import { asStrategy } from '@spa-tools/utilities';

const asMyInterface = asStrategy<string | number>();

const myInterfaceObj = asMyInterface({
  foo: 'hello',
  bar: 42,
});

// now you can access the keys of myInterfaceObj and the
// IDE will magically provide intellisense for the keys
console.log(myInterfaceObj.foo);
```
