# asStrategy()

The `asStrategy<P>()` is a TypeScript utility returns a function, which accepts
a `Record` type and returns it as to enable intellisense on the respective record's
keys in the IDE, similar to behavior of a class instance (or static).

This becomes useful if you have a complex object that you want to use in a `Record`
and use it in many places so getting intellisense on the record's keys really helps.

The generic `P` defines the type (or unioned types) returned from the strategy `Record` values.

### Usage

```ts
import { asStrategy } from '@spa-tools/utilities';

const asMyInterface = asStrategy<string | number>();

const myInterfaceObj = asMyInterface({
  foo: 'hello',
  bar: 42,
});

// now you can access the keys of myInterfaceObj and the
// IDE will magically provide intellisense for the keys
console.log(myInterfaceObj.foo);
```
