# Fallback Route

The `@spa-tools/core-router` allows one route to be specified as a fallback (a.k.a. default, home, 404, etc.) in the event
that no routes match the current browser path. While you can certainly be diligent and maintain tight control over links
and navigation in your app, you cannot control what the user directly enters in the browser URL bar.

This is where the fallback route comes in handy, as it provides a way to gracefully handle invalid URLs in a manner that
makes sense for your application.

```js
import { CoreRouter, routesFactory } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

const createMyRoutes = routesFactory();

// here we create two routes where one will act as our fallback route
const myRoutes = createMyRoutes({
  homeRoute: {
    path: '/',
  },
  aboutRoute: {
    path: '/about',
  },
});

// here we create a new instance of the CoreRouter class and pass in
// our routes object; we also pass in an object that implements the
// router lifecycle callback onRouteChange so we can log outcomes
const myRouter = CoreRouter.initialize(myRoutes, {
  fallbackRoute: myRoutes.homeRoute,
  onRouteChange: (routeChange) => {
    // this is where we would perform any post-processing logic, which
    // typically means rendering the requested route. How to do this
    // ranges based on the UI framework being used, so here we simply
    // log path info to the console.
    //
    // If you're using React or want to create an abstraction for a
    // different rendering package/framework, you should definitely
    // check out the Core React Router abstraction, which has the
    // rendering logic sweetly baked in.
    console.log(`TODO: Render the route: ${routeChange.route.path}`);
  },
});

// first, we navigate to the home route
myRouter.navigate(myRoutes.homeRoute);

// second, we navigate to the about route
myRouter.navigate(myRoutes.aboutRoute);

// third, we navigate to an invalid route
// and you should be able to verify that
// the fallback route kicked in by checking
// the console and your browser's URL
myRouter.navigate({ path: '/invalid' });
```
