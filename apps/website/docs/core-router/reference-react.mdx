## reactRoutesFactory()

The `reactRoutesFactory<R>` function returns a factory method, which when called transforms route
definitions into a _React routes_ object. The resulting routes object is what you use in your app whenever
you need to provide routes to a Core React Router or when you need to specify a route for navigation.

The generic `R` type is used to define the shape of the route that will be created and must
extend the default [`CoreReactRoute`](#corereactroute) type.

### Usage

```tsx
import { CoreReactRoute, reactRoutesFactory } from '@spa-tools/core-router';
import { DashboardView, FinancialsView, LoginView, SignupView } from './views';

// here we define a default layout to use for our normal routes
function MyDefaultLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>My App Header</header>
      <main>{children}</main>
      <footer>My App Footer</footer>
    </div>
  );
}

// here we define a layout that we want to use for our auth flow routes
function MyAuthLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>Login or Sign-up</header>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
}

// adding custom properties to your routes is as simple
// as creating an interface that extends CoreReactRoute
interface MyCustomRoute extends CoreReactRoute {
  requiresAuth: boolean;
}

// to create your routes, first generate a route factory method
const createMyRoutes = reactRoutesFactory<MyCustomRoute>();

// next define and create all of your routes, which you'll
// typically export to use throughout your app
export const myRoutes = createMyRoutes({
  dashboardRoute: {
    Layout: MyDefaultLayout,
    component: <DashboardView />,
    path: '/',
    requiresAuth: true,
  },
  financialsRoute: {
    Layout: MyDefaultLayout,
    component: <FinancialsView />,
    path: '/financials',
    requiresAuth: true,
  },
  loginRoute: {
    Layout: MyAuthLayout,
    component: <LoginView />,
    path: '/login',
    requiresAuth: false,
  },
  signupRoute: {
    Layout: MyAuthLayout,
    component: <SignupView />,
    path: '/signup',
    requiresAuth: false,
  },
});
```

## \<CoreReactRouter /\>

The `CoreReactRouter` component is the single JSX element that handles all of the view rendering for your SPA.

### Usage

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { CoreReactRouter } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <CoreReactRouter
      basePath='/app'
      fallbackRoute={myRoutes.dashboardRoute}
      onRouteChange={(route, state) => {
        console.log('Route changed to:', route, 'with state:', state);
      }}
      onRouteRequest={({ newRoute, newState }) => {
        console.log('Route requested:', newRoute, 'with state:', newState);
        // depending on what you return determines how the router proceeds
        return Promise.resolve(true);
      }}
      routes={myRoutes}
    />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

## useCoreRouter()

The `useCoreRouter` hook is used to access the Core React Router instance from within a function component.

### Usage

```tsx
import { useCoreRouter } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useCoreRouter();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        router.navigate(myRoutes.dashboardRoute);
      }}
    >
      Go to Dashboard
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Returns

Returns a [`CoreRouterHook`](#corerouterhook) object.

## \<NavLink /\>

The `NavLink` component renders a bonafide link that navigates to a route.

### Usage

```tsx
import { NavLink } from '@spa-tools/core-router';

function MyDashboardLink() {
  return <NavLink route={myRoutes.dashboardRoute}>Go to Dashboard</NavLink>;
}
```

## CoreReactRouterNavigate

The `CoreReactRouterNavigate` is the signature for the `navigate` method that is used to navigate to a new route.

```ts
navigate(route, state, hash);
```

| Parameter | Type                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `route`   | `R` or `string`           | yes       | -       | Must be _EITHER_ one of the routes that were created using the factory method generated via [`reactRoutesFactory`](#reactroutesfactory) _OR_ the respective route's path. |
| `state`   | `Record<string, unknown>` | no        | -       | The state to be passed to the new route.                                                                                                                                  |
| `hash`    | `string`                  | no        | -       | The hash to be passed to the new route, which if the target route component contains the respective hash ID, it will auto-scroll to the respective element.               |

## CoreRouteChangePayload

`CoreRouteChangePayload<R>` is the object that is passed to the `onRouteChange` callback when a route change has been processed.

| Property | Type                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                |

| `state`  | `Record<string, unknown>` | no        | -       | The state that was passed to the route. |

## CoreRouteRequestPayload

`CoreRouteRequestPayload<R>` is the object that is passed to the `onRouteRequest` callback when a route change request is pending and ready to act on.

| Property   | Type                      | Required? | Default | Comments                                               |

| `oldState` | `Record<string, unknown>` | no        | -       | The state of the last request that was approved.       |

## CoreRouteResponse

`CoreRouteResponse<R>` is the response that the consumer returns from within the `onRouteRequest` callback when a route change request
is pending and ready to act on. This is used to determine how the Core Router should proceed with the route change request and <strong>thus is
the mechanisim by which consumers maintain absolute control over routing flow logic</strong>.
